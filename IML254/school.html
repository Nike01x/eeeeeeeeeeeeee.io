<p style="text-align:justify;"><font color="white">Here is my Tabika! I attended here when I was 5 to 6 years old with all the kids around my age that live near there. We played and had a lot of fun together. Well, I cannot really remember much but I do remember that I was number 1 when I was 6 years old so that boosted my ego a bit. (though, I don't know what that was at that time.)</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font color="white">Now, here is my first middle school, Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampung Kopok. This school can be dated to before Malaysian independence. It is an old school but when I attended there, there was a lot of new infrastructure that made it look modern with new equipment and roof over the place where we gathered. In this school also I managed to go to Legoland Malaysia when I was 9 years old along with my best friends at the time. It was my first time and it was a core memory. When I was 11, a new school was built a lot more near to my house to the point I didn't need to ride a van to go there. So, save a lot of money on transportation. However, I also need to say goodbye to the friend I made there who does not change school.</font></p>


<img src="eeeeeeeeeeeeee.io\IML254\PIC\skts.jpeg" alt="skts" style="width:500px;height:600px;"> <br>


<p style="text-align:justify;"><font color="white">Here is my second middle school, Sekolah Kebangsaan Taman Scientex. I was the first and the oldest batch attending here. It was still new and they did not take 12 years old because they had an important exam that came up at the end of their year called UPSR which it decided which high school they could get into. My batch was the first student who took UPSR in this school so the pressure is real but it came with special treatment for the 1st class and the 2nd class. Our classroom has airconds, close to the toilet, right beside the library AND we don't need to share the classroom with the afternoon class. It was OUR private classroom. The privileges we got were a lot because we set the first benchmark for the school. It was <i><strong>awesome</strong></i>. The only con was the classroom is on the 5th floor with no elevator. But still, it was worth it. I have the best memories of that school. I also got my 2 lifelong best friends here. One of them is 1 out of 2 students who got straight 6 A's in UPSR... So that's something.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font color="white">Here is my high school, Sekolah Menengah Kebhangsaan Taman Scientex. It was okay. It was hard to transition between middle school and high school but I managed. Form 1... I can't remember much. Nothing really memorable. It was around that time I began to drift off from my childhood friends from Tabika. We communicate and play together occasionally but it was not like before. I don't know what changes, probably puberty that hit me that made me feel awkward around them to the point I became a complete introvert. I felt left off. The silver lining is I still have my middle school friends that I contact regularly so I didn't feel as lonely. Still, seeing myself being awkward with my friends since I was 4 was saddening. But oh well, life goes on. <br><br>Form 2, I gained another friend that I regularly chat with even if it was just a random topic. My Form 2 classmates I can say were the best group of classmates I could ask for. Really active, smart, intelligent, funny, all in one class! It was my best year in high school truthfully. <br><br>Then came form 3, the worst experience I ever had being a high schooler. The classmates were the polar opposite of my class when I'm form 2. They were dumb, loud, obnoxious, made a retiring teacher cry of anger and also made the kindest and low-spoken teacher to be mad! Like, damn. Absolutely no manners in that classroom.<br><br>After a year of that, form 4 came, and.... it was COVID-19 time! collectively, there were only like 3 months' worth of face-to-face classes and the rest were online. Online classes do not suit me. I only attend for the first 2 weeks and for the rest I just doze off. It is just not for me, man. <br><br>I also caught COVID-19 with my sister and was sent to a quarantine zone that one time. Form 5 came and it was hard to catch up on the Form 4 topics because the majority of my classmates also didn't attend online classes so everyone was clueless and rusty by the time the school opened again. Life after COVID was bizzare. everything feels wrong but I don't know what it is. Anyways, it's pretty fun, the teachers are lovely and serious. One time, my batch got to be the third worst performance school in Johor and probably the worst in Pasir Gudang when the SPM trial result came up. how bad you ask? 80% of 300 students failed the exam, even among the first class. Really bad. A lot of tears of disappointment fell that day. The teacher doesn't give up tho, in the end, quite a few people got straight A's (yes, including addmath) so at least they have a happy ending.</font></p>



<p><font color="white">Then, I got accepted to <a href="https://www.example.com">UiTM.</a></font></p>
